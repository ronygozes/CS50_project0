                <p>
                    In the past I have seen most of Europe, some of central America, and a bit of the US in my travels.
                    In 2010 I was in a bike accident, in which my PCL got torn,
                    and ever since then I made it my mission to resume my hiking, and expand on it,
                    starting with climbing, and thru hiking the long distance hiking trails of the world.
                    The list in this page will grow as time goes by, and you are weclome to return at any time to see my most recent adventures.
