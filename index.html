            <p class="first">
                My name is Rony Gozes <br>
                I graduated with Physics major, and Mathematics minor <br>
                from Tel Aviv University <br>
                Currrently, I study Computer Science on my free time and <br>
                I am trying to find a job in high-tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love hiking, climbing, skiing, and my dog <br>
                Unfortunately, I broke my knee 10 years ago, <br>
                and ever since then I made it my top ambition to hike <br>
                the world, and see as much as possible in this life.
